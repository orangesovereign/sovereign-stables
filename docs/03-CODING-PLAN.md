# 03 · Coding Plan (phased)

> How we build it. Each phase ends in something testable in-game. Feature IDs reference `02-FEATURES.md`. Phases are gated: we don't start a phase until its prerequisite tech-prep spikes pass.

## Design principles (apply to every phase)

1. **Data-driven.** Behavior lives in `config/`, not code. A non-dev owner edits configs; code reads them. Every config file is heavily commented and validated at boot (K6, K7).
2. **Bridge everything external.** Core, money, inventory, notify, menu are reached only through `shared/bridge.lua`. Swapping a dependency = editing one adapter (K3). Notify → `sovereign_notify`, menus → `sovereign_menus` from day one (K1, K2).
3. **Module registry.** Features register into a central registry with lifecycle hooks (`onInit`, `onPlayerLoaded`, `onHorseSpawned`, `onTick`, exports). New feature packs drop in without touching the core (K4).
4. **Public API.** A stable exports/events surface so other Sovereign scripts (ranching, medical, jobs) can query/mutate horse state (K5).
5. **Persistence-first.** Any stat that matters survives restart/crash. Server is authoritative; client never decides money, ownership, or stats.
6. **Prototype the risky.** Every 🧪/❓ feature gets a throwaway spike proving the natives work before it enters a build phase.
7. **Model/coat-agnostic catalog.** Code never hardcodes the stock breed roster; the catalog references any installed model/coat (stock or community add-on) by name/hash. See Assets & coats policy in `00-README.md`.
8. **Don't balance away choices — balance away exploits.** *(Owner ruling, 2026-07-15.)* One option being mathematically better than another is **not** a bug. It only warrants a fix if it damages the **economy** (dupes, infinite money), **server health**, or **another player's experience**. A player taking the dull-but-efficient route harms nobody but their own evening — that's a character, not a defect. This server is about choices; the reward for the scenic route *is* the scenic route.

## UI architecture (decided 2026-07-14)

Hybrid, not one-size-fits-all:
- **Custom branded NUI** (`ui/`) for the rich, visual screens — stable storefront/catalog with live horse preview + orbital camera, appearance/painting customizer, horse codex/journal, and the Horse Creator. Sovereign County visual identity but deliberately its own look, distinct from the other sovereign_scripts (which use the shared `sovereign_menus`/`sovereign_notify` chrome).
- **`sovereign_menus`** for lightweight lists, confirmations, and quick prompts (buy confirm, transfer accept, yes/no gates).
- **`sovereign_notify`** for all objective slips / ticks / status cards.
Both sovereign resources are still reached through `bridge.lua`; the custom NUI is a first-class part of this resource.

## DB schema direction

Extend the baseline `stables` table rather than fight it; add columns/tables for new state so migration (K8) stays simple:
- `stables` (baseline) + new: `stable_origin`, `age`, `birth_ts`, `genetics` (json), `personality` (json), `metabolism` (json), `shoes` (json), `bonding`, `courage`, `faction`.
- `horse_lineage` (breeding parentage), `wild_cooldowns` (black-market timers), `foals` (in-progress growth). Design so unused features cost nothing.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation *(no gameplay yet; everything rests on this)*
Resource skeleton, `fxmanifest`, `bridge.lua` (wired to vorp_core + vorp_inventory + sovereign_notify + sovereign_menus), `registry.lua` lifecycle bus, config loader + validator (K6, K7), `db.lua` + `install.sql`, custom NUI shell + branding baseline (L1), empty public API stubs (K5). **Exit test:** resource starts clean, `/stables_diag` prints loaded config + dependency health, NUI shell opens/closes with focus handling.

## Phase 1 — Core Parity MVP *(matches vorp_stables)*
S1–S5, S6, S7, D1–D4, F1, F5, WG1, WG2, WG6, WG13, I1–I3 (catalog scaffold), J-scaffold (J1/J2/J18), L1–L5/L7/L8 (branded storefront, ambient ped, toggleable blips, preview + orbital camera), M1 (breed catalog scaffold), hard death + respawn cooldown, ride transfer, default ride, name tags. Storefront/preview in custom NUI; confirmations via sovereign_menus; notifications via sovereign_notify. Optional-but-cheap: X1/X2/X9 if approved. **Exit test:** buy → store → summon → follow → equip tack → transfer a horse and a wagon in the branded UI, fully persisted. *At this point we have already matched vorp_stables.*

## Phase 2 — Care, Status & Persistence Depth
**Death rework (owner ruling 2026-07-15 — see the Death rules block in 02-FEATURES): H11 (horses are DOWNED like players, instant down on headshot, configurable max downed minutes) + H12 (Horse Reviver items are the only revive) + H13 (max health 150). Permanent death has exactly two causes: age 31 (E6, Phase 3) or downed too long. This RETIRES the long_term_hp cumulative-toll model shipped in 1.3. Leave room for illness/disease/treatment in a later version.** H1 (hunger/thirst), H3 (feed items), H4 (shared/individual status), H5 (clean), **H10 (stabled horses auto-clean after a configurable timer)**, **L9 (storefront preview horses always render clean)**, H8 (rename), C-golden status, S9/E7 (XP-loss-on-restart), S11 (healing service/items), D5 (crash recovery), D9/WG3 (inventory access control), WG4/WG5/WG7/WG9/WG12-basic (wagon color/recovery/rename/health), S14/F2/S15 (component & appearance customization + control UI — **build the customiser on `_SET_META_PED_TAG` `0xBC6DF00D7A4A6819` + palette + tint0/1/2; that, not swapping hash variants, is what the owner's Q1 "colour changes" ruling actually needs**). ~~Gated on the dirt/cleanliness native spike (open question 11)~~ — **UNGATED 2026-07-15: the natives are named** (`SET_PED_DIRT_LEVEL 0x7A56D66C78D1AAB7` + `CLEAR_PED_ENV_DIRT` + `CLEAR_PED_DAMAGE_DECAL` + `_CLEAR_PED_TEXTURE`; see PHASE1_SPIKE_FINDINGS). H5/H10/L9 are now a config timer plus those calls. **Exit test:** a horse gets hungry, is fed/healed, survives a server restart with correct stats, a wagon's health persists, a dirty horse left stabled comes back clean after the configured minutes, and the storefront never shows a dirty horse.

## Phase 3 — Progression, Faction & Advanced Care
E1/E2 (activity leveling), **E9/E10 (the training session + the repertoire)**, **E3/E4 (spook resistance + courage training — the 0–9 ladder, trainer-only, `EVENT_CALM_PED` loop, fear animals)**, **E5-partial (personality → starting tuning params ONLY — *moved up from Phase 4 2026-07-15*: E4 needs personality/breed courage floors to exist, so the mapping must land here; the rest of the trait system stays Phase 4)**, **D8 (terrain/track stumble — *moved up from Phase 4*: `ATB_RagdollEasily` is the same tuning surface and the same spike, so it closes for free here rather than being re-opened later)**, E6 (ageing), S8 (sell aged), S16 (faction stables), S12 (horseshoes), H6 (hoof care), H7 (furs), H9 (tether), F3/F4 (component transfer + saddle stands), D6/D7 (mounted commands), H2 (hay/trough). Gated on the **courage-ladder tuning spike**. **Exit test:** a horse levels through use, ages over time, a trainer walks a green horse to a gator and brings it back braver (courage rises, reads on the owner's info panel, survives a restart), and a faction shares its pool.

## Phase 4 — Wild Horses, Minigames & Economy
W1–W6 (wild lifecycle), S17 (three taming minigames — **`EVENT_HORSE_BROKEN` carries `HBET_STARTED/FAILED/SUCCESS/CANCELLED`, so the state machine is free**), S18 (simulated spawn nodes), S10 (black-market horses + cooldown), S13 (flaming horseshoe), **E5-remainder (the trait system proper — the param mapping shipped in Phase 3)**, WG10/WG11 (dirt/wheel damage). *(D8 moved to Phase 3 — see above.)* **Exit test:** find → tame → store → sell a wild horse; black-market cooldown enforced.

## Phase 5 — Breeding, Genetics, Horse Creator & Work Wagons
G1–G6 (breeding + genetics + foals + neutering), M2 (Horse Creator — job+grade-locked breed authoring), WG8 (wagon crafting), WG14 (work wagons). **Exit test:** breed two horses → genetics resolve → foal grows into a rideable horse with inherited traits; a permitted job creates a new custom breed that others can then buy.

## Phase 6 — Migration, Hardening & Release Candidate
K8 (vorp_stables data migration), K9 (version check), full locale pass, load/stress test, config documentation, README + install guide, v1 RC tag. **Exit test:** a live vorp_stables DB migrates cleanly; owner can install from README alone.

## Tech-prep spikes to run before their phase (from 02-FEATURES open questions)

| Spike | Blocks | Phase gate |
|---|---|---|
| Horse appearance natives (mane/tail/coat/body/furs at runtime + persist) | S14, F1, F2, H7 | 1→2 |
| Golden vs normal core-attribute mapping | H1, H3 | 2 |
| Crash/disconnect recovery pattern | D5, WG5 | 2 |
| ~~Native bonding/courage read/write vs simulate~~ → **Courage ladder tuning** (0–9 → `ATF_BraveryMin/Max`, `ATF_SpookedRangeOverride`, `ATF_FearRange`) + `EVENT_CALM_PED` harness + `ATB_RagdollEasily` stumble odds. *Feasibility is settled — this spike tunes, it no longer proves* | E3, E4, D8 | 3 |
| Mounted anim dicts (side-sit, head-strike) | D6, D7 | 3 |
| Wild ped spawn/persist at custom nodes + cleanup | S18, W1 | 4 |
| ~~Horse dirt/cleanliness native — read + force clean~~ **✅ ANSWERED 2026-07-15, no spike needed** — `SET_PED_DIRT_LEVEL` (`0x7A56D66C78D1AAB7`) is a write path; coal pairs it with `CLEAR_PED_ENV_DIRT` / `CLEAR_PED_DAMAGE_DECAL` / `_CLEAR_PED_TEXTURE` / `ClearPedWetness` for a full clean. `TF_HORSE_DIRTY`/`FILTHY` confirm two tiers | H5, H10, L9, L6 | ~~2~~ — |
| ~~Shiny/gloss coat FX at runtime~~ → likely the same `_SET_META_PED_TAG` palette/tint surface; re-scope before spiking | M3 | 3 |
| Wagon wheel-damage / dirt decal native support | WG10, WG11 | 4 |
| Orbital preview camera (smooth auto-center orbit) | L5 | 1 |
| Genetics/inheritance model design | G1 | 5 |
| Horse Creator — persist & spawn player-authored breeds. **`coal_stables` ships a working `BuildAHorse` + `BuildATack`; read it before designing this** | M2 | 5 |

## What could get cut from v1 RC (if scope pressure hits)
🧪 items are the cut candidates in priority order: WG10/WG11 (dirt/wheel visuals), D7 (head-strike), S13 (flaming shoe), S18 (simulated nodes). These become v1.1. Everything MATCH-tagged is non-negotiable for v1.

*(**D8 is off the cut list** as of 2026-07-15 — `ATB_RagdollEasily` made it a one-line rider on the Phase 3 tuning work. It was only ever a cut candidate because it looked expensive.)*
